# Jacdac for .NET

**Jacdac** is a plug-and-play hardware/software stack 
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators), 
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

This repository contains **.NET Framework 2.0**, **.NET nanoframework** and **TinyCLR** client libraries for the [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) protocol,
as well as transports over USB, SPI, WebSockets.

* **[Jacdac Documentation](https://aka.ms/jacdac/)**
* **[NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Jacdac)**
* Discussions at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/discussions
* Issues are tracked on https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/issues

## Assemblies

The Jacdac project contains C# sources of the Jacdac protocol for various .NET runtime, including desktop or TinyClR.
To avoid mscorlib issues, each platform recompiles these sources into its own assembly where C# files are simply shared as links.
As a result, the C# used in the Jacdac project is .NET Framework 2.0/.NET nanoframework/TinyCLR compatible (and also inherits limitations thereof).

### [.NET Framework 2.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [.NET IoT Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/iot)

  - `Jacdac.NET`, core runtime
  - `Jacdac.NET.Clients`, service clients
  - `Jacdac.NET.Logging`, a logging provider that allows to send log messages over the Jacdac bus
  - `Jacdac.NET.Transports.Spi`, SPI transport layer for SPI Jacdapter using .NET IoT
  - `Jacdac.NET.Transports.WebSockets`, WebSocket transport
  - `Jacdac.NET.Transports.Hf2`, HF2 protocol layer, .NET Framework 2.0
  - `Jacdac.NET.Transports.LibUsb`, Usb transport based on [libusb](https://libusb.info/), .NET Framework 2.0
  - `Jacdac.NET.Servers.SoundPlayer`, .NET Framework 2.0 sound player server implementation

### [TinyCLR](https://www.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/)

  - `Jacdac.TinyCLR`, mirror of `Jacdac` library and UART transport
  - `Jacdac.TinyCLR.Clients`, service clients
  - `Jacdac.TinyCLR.Storage`, SD card storage support

### [.NET nanoframework](https://www.nanoframework.net/)

**Under development**: we need help to either write a native single wire serial transport... or build a SPI HAT for Feather S2.

  - `Jacdac.Nano`, mirror of `Jacdac` library and UART transport
  - `Jacdac.Nano.Transports.Spi`, SPI transport layer for SPI Jacdapter using .NET nanoframework
  - `Jacdac.Nano.Clients`, service clients

### Sample sources

The samples are mostly foud in `./Jacdac/Samples` and cross-compiled into these projects:
- `Jacdac.NET.Playground`, change the command line argument to match the sample type name
- `Jacdac.TinyCLR.Playground`, change the sample type name in `Program.cs`

### Misc:

  - `Jacdac.DevTools`, a .NET Core web site/proxy to help with developing Jacdac applications
  - `Jacdac.Tests`, unit tests, .NET6
  - `Jacdac`, C# Jacdac sources. This package serves as a placeholder for C# files and
    and is not referenced anywhere. **For development purposes only**.

### DevTools

Launch Jacdac.DevTools and use the `WebSocket` transport to connect your Jacdac bus to a local dashboard.
This allows you to test your code against simulators and physical devices, and leverage the tooling
available in the Jacdac network.

To installm,
```
dotnet tool install jacdac.devtools
```

To run,
```
jacdac.devtools
```

Add `spi` on Raspberry Pi to also connect to the JacHAT

## Developer setup

The rest of this page is for developers of the jacdac-dotnet library. For user documentation, go to https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/dotnet.

* clone this repository and pull all submodules
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-dotnet
git submodule update --init --recursive
git pull
```

* Restore Nuget packages. (Either in your preferred IDE/Editor or using `dotnet restore`).
* Execute the desired tool or build the core library using your IDE or `dotnet build`/`dotnet run`

## Testing with .NET and Jacdac development server

* install NodeJS 14+
* install Jacdac cli
```
npm install -g jacdac-cli
```

* launch Jacdac dev tools
```
jacdac devtools
```

* start running or debugging Jacdac.NET.Playground. The webdashboard will serve as a connector to the hardware.

### .NET IoT Raspberry Pi

* Open bash

```
sh ./publish.sh
```

* From a SSH session
```
cd dotnet
dotnet Jacdac.NET.Playground spi
```
